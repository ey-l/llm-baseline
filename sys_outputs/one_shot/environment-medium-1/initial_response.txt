To solve this problem, we need to calculate the exceedance rates for freshwater beaches for 2023 and calculate the historical average exceedance rate from 2002 to 2022. Subsequently, we can determine the difference between these two rates. Below is the step-by-step breakdown:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "environment-medium-1",
        "query": "For the freshwater beaches, what is the difference between the percentage exceedance rate in 2023 and the historic average from 2002 to 2022?",
        "data_sources": [
            "water-body-testing-2002.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2003.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2004.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2005.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2006.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2007.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2008.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2009.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2010.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2011.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2012.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2013.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2014.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2015.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2016.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2017.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2018.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2019.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2020.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2021.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2022.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2023.csv"
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": "environment-medium-1-1",
        "query": "What is the exceedance rate for freshwater beaches in 2023?",
        "data_sources": [
            "water-body-testing-2023.csv"
        ]
    },
    {
        "id": "environment-medium-1-2",
        "query": "What is the historic average exceedance rate for freshwater beaches from 2002 to 2022?",
        "data_sources": [
            "water-body-testing-2002.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2003.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2004.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2005.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2006.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2007.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2008.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2009.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2010.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2011.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2012.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2013.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2014.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2015.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2016.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2017.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2018.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2019.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2020.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2021.csv",
            "water-body-testing-2022.csv"
        ]
    }
]
```

Now, let's create a Python script that can calculate the exceedance rates for 2023 and the historic average from 2002 to 2022.

```python
import pandas as pd
import json
from pathlib import Path

def calculate_exceedance_rate(file_path, start_year=None, end_year=None):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    if start_year is not None and end_year is not None:
        df = df[(df['Year'] >= start_year) & (df['Year'] <= end_year)]
    
    freshwater_df = df[df['Beach Type Description'] == 'Fresh']
    exceedances = freshwater_df[freshwater_df['Violation'].str.lower() == 'yes'].shape[0]
    total_samples = freshwater_df.shape[0]
    
    if total_samples == 0:
        return 0
    
    return (exceedances / total_samples) * 100

def main():
    # Specify the data directory
    data_dir = Path("/Users/eylai/Projects/llm-ds-flow/reference_systems/../../LLMBenchmark/data/environment/")

    # Calculate the exceedance rate for 2023
    exceedance_rate_2023 = calculate_exceedance_rate(data_dir / "water-body-testing-2023.csv")

    # Calculate the historic average exceedance rate from 2002 to 2022
    historical_exceedance_rates = []
    for year in range(2002, 2023):
        file_path = data_dir / f"water-body-testing-{year}.csv"
        rate = calculate_exceedance_rate(file_path)
        historical_exceedance_rates.append(rate)

    historic_average_exceedance_rate = sum(historical_exceedance_rates) / len(historical_exceedance_rates)

    # Calculate the difference
    difference = exceedance_rate_2023 - historic_average_exceedance_rate

    # Print the results
    results = {
        "environment-medium-1-1": exceedance_rate_2023,
        "environment-medium-1-2": historic_average_exceedance_rate,
        "environment-medium-1": difference
    }

    print(json.dumps(results, indent=4))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script calculates the exceedance rates by reading the specified CSV files, filtering the freshwater types, and checking for violations. Then, it calculates the historical and current year's rates and computes their difference.
